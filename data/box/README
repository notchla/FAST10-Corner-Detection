Calibrated image sequences
--------------------------

All images in the sequence are 768x576 pixels.

The files are stored in:

frames/frame_X.png
pngwarps/warp_FROM_TO.png

The indices count from 0.

The files in frames/frame_X.png are the original captured images.

pngwarps/warp_FROM_TO.png describes the warp from image FROM to image TO. These
files store the warp data in 16 bit per channel (with a numeric range of
0--65535), colour PNG format. The destination of the x coordinate is stored as:

x_dest = red / 64.0 - 10.0

and the destination of the y coordinate is:

y_dest = green / 64.0 - 10.0

The blue channel is set to zero. If the destination is (-1, -1) then the pixel
does not warp to within the image, and so should not be used.
