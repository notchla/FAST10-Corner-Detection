Quick start
-----------

Some parts are available without the need to compile or run any programs:

* The best learned FAST-ER tree is in best_faster.tree

* Generated FAST trees for FAST-n and best_faster.tree, along with the trees in
  C++ and MATLAB source code form are in the fast_trees/ directory.

To get started, you will need a unix or unix-like system (it is likely that
Cygwin and MinGW will work) and to compile and install the following libraries:

* From the libCVD project: libCVD and GVars3
* From the TooN project: TooN and tag

These are available from:

* http://svr-www.eng.cam.ac.uk/~er258/cvd/index.html

or from:

* http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/libcvd
* http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/TooN

Once these have been installed, the project can be compiled using the gollowing
command:

./configure && make

Extensive documentation of the source code and how to run the system is
contained in the HTML reference manual (html/index.html) and the PDF reference
manual (refman.pdf).
